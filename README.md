## 📖 Game Rules  

1. The game has **two players**, playing in turns.  
2. On a player's turn:  
   - They can **roll the dice** as many times as they like.  
   - Each roll’s value is added to their **current score**.  
   - If the player rolls a **1**, they lose all points from the current turn and it becomes the opponent’s turn.  
3. The player can choose to **hold**:  
   - Their **current score** is added to their **total score**.  
   - Then it’s the opponent’s turn.  
4. The first player to reach **100 points** (or a chosen target score) **wins the game**. 🎉
